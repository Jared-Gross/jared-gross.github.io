                    <h5>Introduction</h5>
                    <p>
                        My journey into teaching was inspired by the many supportive and dedicated teachers I
                        encountered throughout my education. Their guidance paved the way for me to pursue teaching as a
                        career, and I believe I possess a unique and valuable skill set that can be used to educate and
                        inspire the next generation. At the core of my teaching philosophy is the belief that education
                        should be personalized. Teachers must take the time to listen and engage with students, whether
                        in the classroom or even in passing moments like a brief conversation in the hallway. Building
                        positive relationships is essential, as communication and social connection are lifelong skills
                        that support success. In my classroom, I see myself as both an instructor and a mentor,
                        fostering a learning environment that encourages curiosity, problem-solving, and open
                        discussion. My goal is to teach high school mathematics, science, and humanities in a Hutterian
                        community, while also integrating my passion for computer science and robotics to provide
                        cross-curricular learning experiences. My structured and organized nature, combined with a
                        problem-solving mindset from my programming background, allows me to approach teaching with
                        clarity and purpose, ensuring my students are well-equipped for the future. </p>

                <h4>Conclusion</h4>
                <p>
                    Since beginning my education degree, my perspective on teaching has evolved significantly. I have
                    come to appreciate the vast array of resources available to educators and the many ways in which
                    lessons can be tailored to meet students’ needs. A question that constantly guides my approach is:
                    “What is the best way to teach this?” In the next five years, I aspire to be a professional, calm,
                    confident, and consistent teacher. My goal is to provide students with a personalized academic
                    experience while fostering critical and creative thinking skills. Above all, I want to create a
                    classroom environment where students feel heard, challenged, and inspired to engage with the world
                    around them. </p>

                        <h4>Experience with Children and Adolescents</h4>
                        <p>
                            My understanding of working with young people was shaped by hands-on experience in the classroom
                            even before starting my university studies. Spending a year assisting in various grades allowed me
                            to explore all levels of education and confirm my passion for teaching. During my practicum at
                            Brennan School, I focused on teaching Kindergarten under the guidance of my mentor, Elma Maendel,
                            but I also gained experience working with students up to grade 9. Over time, I have worked with
                            students across all grade levels, from Kindergarten to grade 12. Initially, my interest in education
                            stemmed from the joy of teaching early learners, but as I progressed through my mathematics degree,
                            my focus shifted towards high school education. My practicum experience reinforced this transition,
                            as I found myself drawn to more advanced topics that allowed for deeper critical thinking and
                            problem-solving. </p>

                </div>
                <h4>Successes and Challenges in Practicum</h4>
                <p>
                    One of my biggest takeaways from my practicum was developing my “teacher voice,” which has helped me
                    establish a strong presence in the classroom. I also learned the importance of simply
                    listening—taking a few seconds to engage with students in the hallway can make a significant
                    difference in their day. My teaching strategies center on organization, consistency, and
                    professionalism, which have proven effective. However, I faced challenges in my early teaching
                    experiences, particularly in understanding school policies and structuring lessons to maximize
                    engagement. One area I initially struggled with was closing lessons effectively, but with practice
                    and feedback from my mentor, I have improved my ability to wrap up lessons in a meaningful way. My
                    experience in a Kindergarten classroom provided me with hands-on learning in classroom management,
                    literacy instruction, and student engagement strategies, which have helped shape my overall teaching
                    approach. </p>

                <h4>Teaching Goals and Aspirations</h4>
                <h6>Preferred Grade Levels and Subjects</h6>
                <p>I would prefer to teach grades 8 to 12, particularly in Computer Science, because of my strong
                    background in the subject. I believe I can offer students in these grades a unique perspective on
                    problem-solving and critical thinking, which are essential skills for their future success. These
                    upper-grade levels are a critical time when students can benefit the most from this teaching style,
                    as they are developing higher-level reasoning and analytical skills.</p>

                        <h6>Incorporating Virtue Education</h6>
                        <p>One meaningful experience from my early years of education was a weekly class on virtues taught by
                            one of my teachers. This practice left a lasting impression on me, and I strongly advocate for
                            integrating character education into the curriculum. If given the opportunity, I would like to
                            implement a similar approach in my own classroom to help students develop moral reasoning and
                            ethical decision-making.</p>
                        <h6>Emotional Intelligence and Student Well-Being </h6>
                        <p>An issue I have observed in many individuals is the mislabeling of emotions, which often leads to
                            difficulty in managing them effectively. Emotions are a natural and important part of life, and
                            students need guidance on how to properly identify and navigate their emotions. By fostering
                            emotional intelligence in the classroom, I aim to help students develop self-awareness, emotional
                            regulation, and healthy coping strategies, which are crucial for both their personal and academic
                            growth.</p>

                <h4>Contributions Beyond the Classroom</h4>
                <p>
                    Beyond academics, I envision myself contributing to the school's extracurricular activities by
                    establishing a makerspace with resources for 3D printing, robotics, and electronics. My background
                    in computer science enables me to engage students in innovative ways, such as programming activities
                    connected to their coursework. I also see 3D printing and modeling as valuable tools for fostering
                    creativity and problem-solving. By incorporating these interests into my teaching, I hope to create
                    a dynamic learning environment where students feel encouraged to explore and apply their knowledge
                    in meaningful ways. </p>

                        <h4>Self-Awareness & Critical Reflection</h4>
                        <p>
                            I am mindful of the “curse of knowledge” and actively work to structure my lessons in a way that
                            ensures all students, regardless of prior understanding, can engage with the material. I firmly
                            believe that assessments should only evaluate concepts that have been explicitly taught, as testing
                            students on unfamiliar material is neither fair nor productive. My background and experiences have
                            shaped me into a professional and articulate educator, and I strive to model these qualities for my
                            students. Since I plan to teach in a Hutterite community where many students already know me
                            personally, my focus will be on helping them develop professional communication skills that will
                            benefit them in both academic and real-world settings. </p>

                            One of my key goals for improvement is refining how I close lessons to ensure students leave with a
                            clear understanding of key concepts. I am also interested in exploring professional development
                            opportunities that focus on effective teaching methods for specific topics, allowing me to enhance
                            my instructional techniques. Attending workshops and staying engaged in professional learning
                            communities will help me continue evolving as an educator. Looking ahead to my next practicum, my
                            primary goal is to improve my classroom management skills, particularly in handling disruptions and
                            guiding students more effectively. </p>
