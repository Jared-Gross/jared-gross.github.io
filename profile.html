                    <h5>Introduction</h5>
                    <p><strong>What inspired you to become a teacher?</strong></p>
                    <p>
                        I was fortunate to have many inspiring and supportive teachers who guided me throughout my
                        education. Their encouragement played a crucial role in my decision to pursue teaching as a
                        career. Additionally, I believe I possess a unique and valuable skill set that can be used to
                        educate and inspire the next generation. </p>
                    <p><strong>What are your core values and beliefs about education?</strong></p>
                    <p>
                        I believe in a personalized approach to teaching. Teachers should invest time in listening and
                        engaging with students, both in and out of the classroom. Even a brief conversation in the
                        hallway can make a difference.
                    </p>
                    <p>Building positive relationships is crucial for student success. Teaching students how to connect
                        socially and communicate effectively is a lifelong skill that will benefit them in various
                        aspects of life. Additionally, fostering critical thinking and problem-solving skills is
                        essential. Encouraging students to verbalize their thought processes and engage in meaningful
                        discussions is a key part of my teaching philosophy.</p>
                    <p><strong>How do you see your role in the classroom and in the school community?</strong></p>
                    <p>
                        I aim to teach high school-level mathematics, science, and English or social studies in my
                        Hutterian community. My strong background in computer science and robotics makes me passionate
                        about integrating these subjects alongside core curriculum requirements to create a
                        cross-curricular learning environment.
                    </p>
                    <p><strong>What strengths do you bring to the teaching profession?</strong></p>
                    <p>
                        My background in computer science and programming provides me with strong problem-solving and
                        critical-thinking skills. These abilities are transferable to various subjects and will be
                        valuable for students to experience firsthand. Additionally, I am highly structured and
                        organized, which aligns well with the responsibilities of a teacher.

                        <h4>Experience with Children and Adolescents</h4>
                        <p><strong>What past experiences have shaped your understanding of working with young
                                people?</strong></p>
                        <p> Before starting university, I spent a year assisting in various classrooms, which allowed me
                            to experience working with students across all grade levels. This experience helped me
                            determine my interest in teaching and the age group I would prefer to work with.
                        </p>
                        <p>During my first practicum at Brennan School, I worked under Elma Maendel, my mentor teacher.
                            While I was assessed on teaching Kindergarten, I also gained experience teaching students up
                            to Grade 9.</p>
                        <p><strong>What grade levels and subjects have you worked with so far?</strong></p>
                        <p> I have worked with all grades from Kindergarten to Grade 12.
                        </p>
                        <p><strong>How have these experiences influenced your teaching philosophy?</strong></p>
                        <p> My initial interest in teaching was fueled by the joy of working with young learners and
                            witnessing their enthusiasm for learning. However, as I pursued my undergraduate degree in
                            Mathematics, I gradually shifted my focus to high school education.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Teaching at Brennan School helped me realize that Early Years teaching was not the best fit
                            for me, despite my training. I felt a strong desire to challenge myself and my students with
                            more advanced topics.

                <h4>Successes and Challenges in my First Practicum</h4>
                <h6>Key Moments During my Practicum</h6>
                <p>One of my most significant growth areas was developing my teacher voice.
                </p>
                <p>Additionally, my faculty supervisor noted that I demonstrated strong lesson planning, organization,
                    and adaptability, especially in multi-grade classrooms.

                </p>
                <h6>Challenges and How I Navigated Them</h6>
                <p>One of my biggest challenges was a lack of experience with school policies and strategies.
                </p>
                <p>However, with time and practice, I learned how to better manage classroom transitions and lesson
                    closures.</p>

                <h4>Teaching Goals and Aspirations</h4>
                <p><strong>What grade levels or subjects do you see yourself teaching in the future? Why?
                    </strong></p>
                <p>I would prefer to teach Grades 8–12, particularly in Computer Science. My strong background in this
                    field allows me to offer students a unique perspective on problem-solving and critical thinking,
                    both of which are essential life skills.</p>
                <p>One of my most impactful educational experiences was having a teacher who conducted a weekly virtues
                    class. This approach resonated with me, and I would love to incorporate a similar character
                    education program into my teaching.</p>
                <p>Additionally, I have noticed that many people mislabel their emotions, which prevents them from
                    managing their feelings effectively. Teaching students how to navigate emotions in a healthy and
                    constructive manner is something I believe is crucial.</p>

                        <p><strong>What teaching methods or approaches do you feel most comfortable using?</strong></p>
                        <p>I am structured, organized, and punctual. I value details and ensure that students fully
                            understand concepts rather than leaving them to figure things out on their own.</p>
                        <p><strong>What are some innovative strategies you’d like to try in your future
                                classroom?</strong></p>
                        <p>I would like to implement a more ungraded approach, where I engage in conversations with
                            students about their progress. By doing this, I can gain a deeper understanding of their
                            learning journey.</p>
                        <p>Additionally, I believe formative and summative assessments should be balanced. Formative
                            assessments should challenge students’ understanding rather than simply testing their recall
                            of information.</p>

                <h4>Contributions Beyond the Classroom</h4>
                <p><strong>How do you see yourself contributing to extracurricular activities?</strong></p>
                <p>
                    I would like to establish a makerspace in my classroom, equipped with 3D printing, robotics, and
                    electronics.</p>
                <p>
                    Additionally, I am passionate about teaching social and emotional intelligence. In today’s
                    digital-driven world, these skills are often overlooked but remain essential.
                </p>
                <p><strong>How do your hobbies and interests support student engagement?</strong></p>
                <p>My background in computer science allows me to introduce unique approaches to problem-solving and
                    critical thinking.</p>
                <p>Furthermore, I am interested in 3D printing and modeling, which would provide students with
                    opportunities to develop creative solutions to real-world problems.</p>

                <h4>Evolving Teaching Philosophy</h4>
                <p>
                    I aspire to be a calm, confident, and professional teacher who fosters critical and creative
                    thinking following a growth-mindset while prioritizing student-centered learning.</p>

                        <h4>Self-Awareness & Critical Reflection</h4>
                        <p><strong>What are some beliefs about teaching that you are beginning to question?</strong></p>
                        <p>I am mindful of the "curse of knowledge"—the assumption that what I know is common knowledge.
                            I believe that by applying a structured, problem-solving-oriented approach, I can mitigate
                            this bias.</p>
                        <p>Additionally, I believe teachers should only assess what they explicitly teach. There is no
                            reason to include questions on an assessment that have not been thoroughly covered in class.
                        </p>
                        <p><strong>How do your personal experiences shape your classroom interactions?</strong></p>
                        <p>I take a professional, punctual, and articulate approach in both digital and real-life
                            interactions.</p>
                        <p>As I plan to teach within a Hutterite community, many students will already know me. Thus,
                            modeling professionalism and clear communication is crucial.</p>
